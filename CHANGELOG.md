# Changelog

All notable changes follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and releases follow semantic versioning.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `NOD002` reports a `noqa` directive that names `NOD001` without suppressing anything, inline or file-level. `--fix` removes the directive, or just the `NOD001` code when the directive lists others. Blanket directives are never reported because they may belong to another linter, and a blanket `# ruff: noqa` or `# flake8: noqa` still silences the whole file.
- `--fix` now warns that call sites are not updated when it removes defaults.

### Documentation

- Document that `--fix` rewrites signatures only, so callers that relied on a removed default fail at runtime.
- Document registering `NOD` in Ruff's `lint.external`, without which `ruff check --fix` deletes `# noqa: NOD001` suppressions.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- Annotated assignments inside the methods of a dataclass are no longer reported as dataclass fields. They are locals, and `--fix` removed their values to leave bare annotations that raised `NameError` at runtime.

### Added

- Continuous Rust performance tracking with CodSpeed and Divan benchmarks.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Ruff-style closest-configuration discovery and per-file enforcement.
- Ruff-style full, concise, JSON, and GitHub Actions output.
- `--fix`, `--diff`, `--show-settings`, inline `noqa`, and file-level `ruff: noqa` support.
- Atomic fixes that preserve non-default dataclass `field(...)` metadata.
- A pinned Typeshed benchmark and real-project integration fixture.
- Cross-platform wheel, GitHub Release, and trusted PyPI publishing automation.

### Changed

- Unannotated dataclass class attributes are no longer treated as fields.
